    <h2>Smaller Projects & Experiments</h2>
    <h3> Winds of the Wanderer</h3>
    <p>
        Winds of the Wanderer was a project that I was working on during college for one of my major projects. It was originally made in Construct 2, but after I had left the course in 2017, I began rebuilding it in Game Maker Studio 2, improving on it and turning it into something much bigger. I originally wanted to make sure I developed it until completion, however I soon started to realise that it had very little character or anything that made it unique, so after a year or developer's block, I went back to the drawing board and came up with a character that felt recognisable, and a theme to go with it. That game ended up becoming Project Emberseed. In fact, the tilemap and background assets from this game's final build were ported straight into Emberseed, and are still in use to this day.
