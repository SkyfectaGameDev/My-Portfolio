        <p class="contentAlign"> Project Emberseed is a 2D platformer that focuses on using the environment to your ability, rather than having innate abilities that the character has by default. Essentially, the environment you find yourself in is what determines what mechanics you can use, what routes to take, and how to progress through the game.</p>

        <p class="contentAlign"> Project Nebula is a shoot 'em up game inspired by the likes of Thunder Force, Darius Gaiden, Radiant Silvergun, and the whole 90's era for the genre. It uses a 3D, low-poly style. I would usually use pixel art, however the 3D engine allows me to achieve the game's main goal - sifting perspectives. My game is attempting something that has never really been seen before - and that is switching between top-down and sidescrolling perspectives!</p>

        <p class="contentAlign"> Currently, I am working on two projects completely solo. I have also done lots of little prototypes in the past, so take a look at my reel! A few of these ideas have been in the making for a couple of years as far as planning goes, but development is currently inconsistent thanks to life being extremely busy in general.</p>
