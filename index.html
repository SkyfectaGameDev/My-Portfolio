    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hey! My name is Alisha, and I'm a programmer. Ever since I was a kid and got my hands on a computer, I had always had a thirst for knowledge and to learn how to understand them both inside and out. Because of this, throughout my history of education, I have always gravitated towards the more technical subjects - such as Computer Science, ICT, Programming, etc. I even do a bit of video editing and graphic design as a hobby! Recently, I've been learning more about Web Development (you're reading this from a website I made, after all!) and more standard programming languages - such as Python, JavaScript and C. However, where my interests are sparked the most is in Games Programming. So far, I have worked with Unity, Godot, UE4/5, GameMaker Studio 2, Construct 2/3, and I've even done some light research into lesser-known engines such as the Delver Engine and PICO-8.

        The catalyst for all of this was definitely finding out how to mod games, starting with simple texture swaps in games like Minecraft. Nowadays, I've made some more heavy mods on some of the 2D Sonic games. Regardless, if you want to hear more about these things, you can head over to their respective pages to view the portfolios I have built up!

    <h3>Other Hobbies</h3>
    <p>
        When I'm not programming, I can normally be expected to be spending my time playing games, looking after my pet spider, hanging out with friends or focusing on my other hobbies. One of said hobbies has only been a recent endeavour - having only picked it up for the past two years, I have found myself learning more and more about the hardware of devices - paticularly older ones. I have a workstation in my room that allows me to carry out repairs and refurbishments of cassette tape players, handheld game consoles, controllers, and much more!
