    <p class="contentAlign"> Hey! My name is Alisha, and I am 21 years old. I am an indie game developer, a content creator, and a graphics design hobbyist. People better know me through these things through my online name - "Skyfecta". This is a personal page and space to share my creations, ideas, or to simply put boards of inspiration together to assist me in creating new projects! 
    <br>
    <br>
    I've been pursuing a career in IT or game development since 2015 - which was when I figured out exactly what I wanted to do in high school. I took Computing and ICT as my options for GCSE, and fgollowed that up wiht an Interactive Media & Games course at college - where I was awarded a distinction. From there, I went to university, where I entered a Games Design & Programming course, however thanks to covid and other issues going on in my personal life, I had to pull out. Since then, I have focused on doing lots of programming and development in my own spare time as a way to build up my portfolio, and carry on with my goal to pursue a career in the IT and/or programming fields.
    <br>
    <br>
    Alongside this, I have tought myself some graphic art skills, as being a one-person team on everything I do means I need to do everythign myself. So, over the years since around 2017, I have taught myself how to use Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, Aseprite, and even video editing software such as Wondershare Filmora and DaVinci Resolve. I mostly do this to make my hobbies stand out better, and because it saves money to know how to do this myself - but I also genuinely really enjoy it, too.
    <br>
    <br>
    And finally, that leads on to my content creation hobby. As I stated previously, I know how to edit videos - and with that skill comes with the ability to create and share videos! I have mainly focused on video-game related media, but my editing skills go beyond that and into editing pretty much any video that needs to be done.

    <p class="contentAlign"> When I'm not behind the screen, you can often find me cooking, swimming, writing, or refurbishing old technology to bring new life into it. I'm a HUGE fan of cassettes, VHS tapes and old/obscure media formats in general. My first games console was a Sega Mega Drive, despite not growing up in that era! I had a love for 2D platformers as a kid, and when my parents noticed that they bought me one on Christmas 2005. Ever since then, my obsession with older media and games began - and the older I got, the more I knew I wanted to explore it more. </p>
