    <h2>Graphic Art</h2>
    <p>Whilst Graphic Art is certainly not my main interest, it's certainly quite high up on my list of hobbies. I mostly got into doing it through making thumbnails for YouTube videos as a teenager and followed it through for a little while in high school, taking it as one of my options. Not long afterwards, it lead me towards doing some art and UI design for games. Nowadays I am learning how to do game art in my spare time - with pixel art taking a priority.</p>

    <!----- Logos & Banners Section ----->
    <h3>Logos & Banners</h3>
    <p>As stated above, I got into graphic art through making logos, banners, thumbnails, icons, watermarks, etc. for my content creation on websites like YouTube and Twitch. Below are some examples of what I have created for both my own and other people's channels.</p>
    <div id="art-container">
        <img id="art-image-std" src="Images/Graphic/Picture13.png" alt="Concept logo with the word 'pastel' formatted within a white circle and white accents.">
        <img id="art-image-std" src="Images/Graphic/Logo.png" alt="A small version of the Skyfecta logo.">
        <img id="art-image-std" src="Images/Graphic/analog.jpg" alt="A logo for Analogged - a channel about old media formats such as cassettes and CDs">
        <img id="art-image-banner" src="Images/Graphic/Picture15.png" alt="The banner for an old game concept called 'Strike Force Nebula'.">

    <!----- YouTube Video Thumbnails Section ----->
    <h3>YouTube Video Thumbnails</h3>
    <p>As someone who did a lot of video editing, and as a kid with little money to spare - I learned Photoshop and GIMP to create my own thumbnails for videos I made. They used to be rather simple, but nowadays I believe I have learned how to really make a thumbnail pop when it needs to. Because of this, I have had other people commission me to make some thumbnails for them.</p>
    <div id="art-container">
        <img id="art-image-std" src="Images/Graphic/Picture2.png" alt="Thumbnail for a video about the game 'Delver'.">
        <img id="art-image-std" src="Images/Graphic/Picture1.png" alt="Thumbnail for a video about a character in the game 'Risk of Rain 2'.">
        <img id="art-image-std" src="Images/Graphic/Picture4.jpg" alt="Thumbnail for a video in a short series made in the game 'Garry's Mod'.">
        <img id="art-image-std" src="Images/Graphic/lowres.PNG" alt="Thumbnail for a video essay about whether retro games look better at low resolutions.">
        <img id="art-image-std" src="Images/Graphic/alcasist.png" alt="Thumbnail for a short horror video.">

    <!----- Album Cover Concepts (CD & Casette) Section ----->
    <h3>Album Cover Concepts (CD & Cassette)</h3>
    <p>For a couple of years now, I have been working on a story -  and a big part of influencing that storyu was music. I made playlists of music that represented different places, people, story beats, and more. This alone caused me to fall in love wth music moreso than before - especially the older and physical formats, such as cassettes. So, I decided to create some concept art for what it could look like if this story had a couple of official soundtracks. I also made a fan-made Streets of Rage 4 Soundtrack cassette J-card design since the game was a throwback to an early 90's series, and it seemed fitting.</p>
